Deep dive into reactive programming concepts with Spring WebFlux and MongoDB with hands on experience

## Description

Reactive applications are dominating the enterprise landscape in the next decade. Using Spring WebFlux and reactive Mongodb reactive applications can be implemented with minimal boiler plate code. With explosion of cloud computing, iot, bigdata, mobile computing,etc application requirements have changed drastically. User expectations are sky rocketing. The challenges which are being faced by enterprises are immense. Users want a seamless experience with applications. So Software applications have to evolve accordingly to cope with rapid changes in requirements. And the traditional three-tier software architecture  will not be able to solve these challenges. So to stay ahead of the game your application should be built on a robust architecture that can respond to change, handle load spikes, guarantee 100% up time, and adapt to failures while reducing cost. So answer is reactive systems. When you implement reactive architectures reactive programming and reactive frameworks play a crucial role. Spring Web Flux is a modern state of the art web framework with lot of plumbing done to ease the life of solution providers. Also Mongodb is well integrating document database with Spring WebFlux in reactive fashion. So by learning Reactive programming with spring web flux with Mongodb you are preparing your self to implement reactive architectures in highly maintainable and modular fashion.

This course primarily focuses on delivering in depth knowledge on reactive Mongodb concepts and leveraging them with Spring WebFlux, reactive spring data Mongodb environment. Course covers **MongoDB 4.4** and **Spring WebFlux 2.4** stable versions.

You will grasp crucial concepts like:
 - reactive systems,
 - reactive programming, 
 - Mongodb architecture, 
 - Docker based replicasets, 
 - reactive Rest Apis with concurrency, 
 - reactive MQL, 
 - reactive aggregates, 
 - reactive GridFS, 
 - reactive transactions, 
 - reactive error handling with Spring WebFlux and MongoDB 

Hands on guidance will guide to groom you to be a professional reactive Mongodb, Spring WebFlux developer/architect while covering wide area of enterprise reactive application landscape. There are 26 lectures available covering key areas.This is an ideal course for developers, architects or anybody keen on exploring modern reactive frameworks and reactive databases.
